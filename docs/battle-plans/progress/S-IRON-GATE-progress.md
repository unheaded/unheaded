# S-IRON-GATE progress log

Plan: `docs/battle-plans/S-IRON-GATE-battle-plan.md`. This file is the session log the plan refers to, and where
`[STUCK]` / `[ESCALATE]` markers live; step ticks live in the plan.

Skip Protocol acknowledgment: "I will skip any step after 3x its estimate or 2 failed debug attempts, mark
it [STUCK] with what I tried, commit known-good state first, continue with the next step that does not depend
on it, and finish with a STUCK/ESCALATE report ordered by how many steps each item unblocks."

## Session S24, 2026-10-27 evening (unattended, Stevie's "churn unattended multi agent")

Base: develop `1f44cc46` (S-CLEAN-SLATE shipped; Go known failures 0). Same pattern as Sprint 1: a coordinator
on develop and worktree agents under one brief (`EXEC-BRIEF-v2`: reset to develop first, never push, no host
changes, no shared-ledger edits, gate exit codes read directly). Phase 0 premises are checked per slice by each
agent, since SITUATION was written at `a7fe3acd` and Sprint 1 changed many of them.

First wave: Phase 1 (pkg/auth core, Steps 29-66) in a worktree agent; next: Phases 2+3 after it merges, then 4; Phases 11 and 12 can run beside them (not beside S-WELL-SPRING Phase 8: both touch every router).
